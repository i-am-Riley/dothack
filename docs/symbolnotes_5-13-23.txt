// p_offset is the start of the MIPS assembly
// p_offset + p_filesz will get you to section names
// e_shoff will get you to the section headers
// first section header is null

// .mwcats stands for MetroWerks CodeWarrior Analysis Tools Suite (CATS)

// DWARF version 2 wasn't used since .debug_info headers are missing
// .debug contains a lot of the info.

// there might be DWARF usage in the demo discs. there is a header
// .mdebug.eabi64 that ChatGPT suggests is DWARF.
